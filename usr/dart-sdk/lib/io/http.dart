/**
 * A server that delivers content, such as web pages, using
 * the HTTP protocol.
 *
 * The [HttpServer] is a [Stream] of [HttpRequest]s. Each
 * [HttpRequest] has an associated [HttpResponse] object as its
 * [HttpRequest.response] member, and the server responds to a request by
 * writing to that [HttpResponse] object.
 *
 * Incomplete requests where all or parts of the header is missing, are
 * ignored and no exceptions or [HttpRequest] objects are generated for them.
 * Likewise, when writing to a [HttpResponse], any [Socket] exceptions are
 * ignored and any future writes are ignored.
 *
 * The [HttpRequest] exposes the request headers, and provides the request body,
 * if it exists, as a stream of data. If the body is unread, it'll be drained
 * when the [HttpResponse] is being written to or closed.
 *
 * The following example shows how to bind a [HttpServer] to a IPv6
 * [InternetAddress] on port 80, and listening to requests.
 *
 *     HttpServer.bind(InternetAddress.ANY_IP_V6, 80).then((server) {
 *       server.listen((HttpRequest request) {
 *         // Handle requests.

/**
 * A server-side object
 * that contains the content of and information about an HTTP request.
 *
 * __Note__: Check out the
 * [http_server](http://pub.dartlang.org/packages/http_server)
 * package, which makes working with the low-level
 * dart:io HTTP server subsystem easier.
 *
 * HttpRequest objects are generated by an [HttpServer],
 * which listens for HTTP requests on a specific host and port.
 * For each request received, the HttpServer, which is a [Stream],
 * generates an HttpRequest object and adds it to the stream.
 *
 * An HttpRequest object delivers the body content of the request
 * as a stream of bytes.
 * The object also contains information about the request,
 * such as the method, URI, and headers.
 *
 * In the following code, an HttpServer listens
 * for HTTP requests and, within the callback function,
 * uses the HttpRequest object's `method` property to dispatch requests.
 *
 *     final HOST = InternetAddress.LOOPBACK_IP_V4;
 *     final PORT = 4040;
 *
 *     HttpServer.bind(HOST, PORT).then((_server) {
 *       _server.listen((HttpRequest request) {
 *         switch (request.method) {
 *           case 'GET':
 *             handleGetRequest(request);
 *             break;
 *           case 'POST':
 *             ...
 *         }
 *       },
 *       onError: handleError);    // listen() failed.
 *     }).catchError(handleError);
 *
 * Listen to the HttpRequest stream to handle the
 * data and be notified once the entire body is received.
 * An HttpRequest object contains an [HttpResponse] object,
 * to which the server can write its response.
 * For example, here's a skeletal callback function
 * that responds to a request:
 *
 *     void handleGetRequest(HttpRequest req) {
 *       HttpResponse res = req.response;
 *       var body = [];
 *       req.listen((List<int> buffer) => body.add(buffer),
 *         onDone: () {
 *           res.write('Received ${body.length} for request ');
 *           res.write(' ${req.method}: ${req.uri.path}');

 *         },

 * first future completes with a [HttpClientRequest] the underlying
 * network connection has been established, but no data has yet been
 * sent. The HTTP headers and body can be set on the request, and
 * [:close:] is called to sent it to the server.
 *
 * The second future, which is returned by [:close:], completes with
 * an [HttpClientResponse] object when the response is received from
 * the server. This object contains the headers and body of the
 * response.

 * The future for [HttpClientRequest] is created by methods such as
 * [getUrl] and [open].
 *
 * When the HTTP response is ready a [HttpClientResponse] object is
 * provided which provides access to the headers and body of the response. The
 * body is available as a stream implemented by [HttpClientResponse].
 * If a body is present, it must be read. Otherwise, it'll lead to a resource
 * leaks. Consider using [HttpClientResponse.drain] if the body is unused.
 *
 *     HttpClient client = new HttpClient();
 *     client.getUrl(Uri.parse("http://www.example.com/"))
 *         .then((HttpClientRequest request) {

 *
 *     Accept-Encoding: gzip
 *
 * This allows the HTTP server to use gzip compression for the body if
 * possible. If this behavior is not desired set the
 * "Accept-Encoding" header to something else.
 *
 * The [HttpClient] supports persistent connections and caches network
 * connections to reuse then for multiple requests whenever
 * possible. This means that network connections can be kept open for
 * some time after a request have completed. Use [:HttpClient.close:]
 * to force shut down the [HttpClient] object and close the idle
 * network connections.
